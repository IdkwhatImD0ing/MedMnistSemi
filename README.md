## Dataset
This dataset is not the complete MedMNIST dataset. A subset of 6 different classes along with 60 labeled and around 50k unlabeled images were used to train this model.

Each class had 10 labeled images. 

Dataset is contained in MedMnist folder.

## Training the Model
The given labeled dataset was split into two parts, one for training and one for validation.

## Results
Transfer learning using MobileNet resulted in 99.5% testing accuracy.


## How to reproduce the results
Run the attached python file.
Some modules may have to be installed ahead of time.
